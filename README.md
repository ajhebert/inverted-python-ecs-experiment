**Pyces** is a simple Entity-Component-System written in Python. It is named after the constellation, Pisces, and pronounced the same. For better or worse, Pyces might be a dyslexic reading of 'PyECS'. 

It's a star fish, but not an echinoderm.

# Usage
Copy `src/pyces/ecs.py` to your local project directory and have at it.
